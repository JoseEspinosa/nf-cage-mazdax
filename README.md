# BovReg nf-cage pipeline 
This is a CAGE analysis pipeline used in BovReg consortium (https://www.bovreg.eu/) studies. This pipeline was wrapped using NextFlow DSL2 syntax from demultiplexing to base pair resolution and strand specific read counting <br> (i.e. compatible for import to CAGEfightR https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAGEfightR.html)

Pipeline has the following steps: 
1. Demultiplexing raw CAGE sequence data using _FASTXtoolkit_ (allowed mismatch 1)
2. Trimming CAGE tags using _tagDust2_ (HMM read architecture provided) 
3. QC before and after (_FastQC_ and _MultiQC_)
4. Mapping against reference genome [ARS-UCD1.2_Btau5.0.1Y 1000 bull project](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~stothard/1000_bull_genomes/) using bowtie2
5. BAM >>> bp resolution bedGraph for +ve and -ve strands >>>> bigWig


# Installation

Install the latest NextFlow engine on your system following the instructions available at https://www.nextflow.io/<br>
After a successful install you should be able to query the following without any errors: 

```
nextflow info
  Version: 22.04.3 build 5703
  Created: 18-05-2022 19:22 UTC (20:22 BST)
  System: Linux 5.10.102.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2
  Runtime: Groovy 3.0.10 on OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.9.1-internal+0-adhoc..src
  Encoding: UTF-8 (UTF-8)
```

You would need to use the docker container for reproducibility of the analysis. Please follow the installation guidelines of Docker on your system : https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ or the desktop client (installs the engine and GUI as the same time) https://docs.docker.com/desktop/<br>

Download this code repository and the respective docker image (Tested on WSL2 Windows 10 and Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) 

```

git clone https://github.com/MazdaX/nf-cage.git
docker pull mazdax/nf-cage:latest

```
_NB. Running this pipeline without docker would require modification of module nf scripts and its not recommended_
_NB. The docker image will be converted to a singularity sif using the -profile singularity _

# Quick Start

The help manu can be access as following: 

```
nextflow run . --help

This is a CAGE analysis pipeline used in the BovReg consortium project (https://www.bovreg.eu/).
This pipeline was wrapped using NextFlow DSL2 syntax from demultiplexing to base pair resolution 
and strand specific read counting. The output for each single end FASTQ file are 2 bedGraph
(+,-strands) bp resolution CAGE tag counts. The bedGraph outputs can be directly used in the CAGEfightR
package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAGEfightR.html)

Pipeline has the following steps:

- Demultiplexing raw single end CAGE sequence data using FASTXtoolkit (allowed mismatch 1)
- Trimming CAGE tags using tagDust2 
(HMM read architecture provided: -1 B:${barcode} -2 F:CAGNNNG -3 R:N -4 P:ATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTT -dust 100)
- QC before and after (FastQC and MultiQC)
- Mapping against reference genome ARS-UCD1.2_Btau5.0.1Y 1000 bull project using bowtie2
- BAM >>> bp resolution bedGraph for +ve and -ve strands >>>> bigWig
======================================================================
      

    Pipeline version: 0.0.1
    
    Typical usage:
            nextflow run . -profile singularity 
    
    Parameters:
    
    --help              Prints this message

    --ref_fasta         URL address to the reference FASTA File 
                        (e.g. "http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_fasta/bos_taurus/dna/Bos_taurus.ARS-UCD1.2.dna.toplevel.fa.gz")

    --raw_fastq         Address of the folder containing gz-compressed CAGE (SE libraries before demux) FASTQ files
                        (e.g. --raw_fastq fastq_files/*.gz)

    --barcodes          Tab separated file with no header for the input barcodes to be used in demux 
                        (i.e. sampleName\tbarcode)
                        
    --allowed_mismatch  The number of barcode mismatches allowed by the fastx_barcode_splitter.pl script
                         (default: 1)
```


Sample FASTQ files are in the root folder (fastq_files) along with the barcodes per samples (barcode_files). Replace the files inside these 2 folders with your own experimental data in order to run the pipeline on your dataset. 

```
nextflow run . -profile singularity

```

or 

```
nextflow run -profile docker .

# Container and toolset
This pipeline uses a docker container for all the tools required and the mamba environment. Please find the details at Docker hub public repository https://hub.docker.com/r/mazdax/nf-cage :
```
docker pull mazdax/nf-cage:latest
```
The list of the tools and versions are available in the __environment.yml__ and the __Dockerfile__. 
The aria2c compilation was modified using https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/johngong/aria2/dockerfile .

```
docker build -t mazdax/nf-cage:aria2c .
```

NB. nf-core and pyinquirer packages were manually removed from the docker builds. 
NB. The main branch contains tested pipeline and for nf-core compatibility a "nfcore_opt" branch was created.
NB. The dev and dev_hpc branches were merged in to main for the final version.
